The [Science of Science and Computational Discovery (SOS+CD) Lab](https://scienceofscience.org) encourages and welcomes undergraduate students to participate in  exciting research projects!

The SOS+CD Lab works on understanding current practices in science and developing semi-automated methods to mine scientific knowledge from vast, unstructured dataset of full-text publications, citations, and images.   

We use various computational techniques, including:
- Deep Learning 
- Natural Language Processing
- Graph Analytics 
- Image Processing
- Causal Inference 

We use tools like:  
- Python
- SQL
- Spark
- TensorFlow
- PyTorch

Those tools and techniques are important for aspiring quantitative researchers, data scientists and data analytics to have a successful career in either academia or industry.  Participating in our research projects would be a great experience to get your hands dirty.
